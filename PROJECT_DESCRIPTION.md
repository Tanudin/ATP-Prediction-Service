This project implements an end-to-end machine learning system for predicting ATP tennis match outcomes using XGBoost classification. The system processes historical match data from 2000-2024 (128,328 samples from 64,166 matches) sourced from Kaggle, 45 features including player rankings, ATP points, win percentages, and surface-specific performance metrics, and achieves 61.01% accuracy on 2025 test data. The model identifies ranking differential, win percentage differential, and ATP points differential as the most important predictive features, demonstrating that current form and ranking remain strong indicators of match outcomes in professional tennis.

The service is deployed as an interactive Streamlit dashboard hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud, providing real-time match predictions, backtesting analysis, and betting strategy comparisons. An automated pipeline orchestrated through GitHub Actions runs daily at 3 AM to fetch new match data from Kaggle, generate predictions, and retrain the model with updated data, which is then stored in the Hopsworks feature store for versioning and reproducibility. The 2025 backtest reveals that while the model achieves positive accuracy, a smart betting strategy (betting only on matches with ≥65% confidence) improves accuracy to 67.4% and reduces losses compared to betting on all matches, highlighting the importance of selective prediction deployment in real-world applications.
